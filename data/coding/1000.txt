DOD’s Renaissance Enters A New Phase With The Chthonic Fuzz – The First New Pedal From The Rejuvenated Brand
DOD Chthonic

Last year, Cort Guitars parent company Cor-Tek announced it had purchased both the DigiTech and DOD pedal brands from Samsung, with the intention of rejuvenating the two beloved effects institutions.

It was an announcement that prompted intense speculation from pedal fans (many believe a new Whammy pedal is in the pipeline), who were later appeased with a string of DOD reissues.

These include relaunched versions the Overdrive Preamp 250, Compressor 280, Envelope Filter 440 and Gonkulator.

Now, though, DOD has debuted the Chthonic fuzz pedal – the company’s first new release proper since it was acquired by Cor-Tek.

Notably, it’s also the first pedal to be released by the rejuvenated DigiTech/DOD brands since it was confirmed back in May that some of the two respective brands’ most influential minds had been recruited to spearhead the renaissance.
